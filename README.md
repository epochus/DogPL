# Dog - Scala Internal DSL

This is a variant of the Dog Programming Language created as an Internal DSL in Scala.
To see the original documentation, click [here](http://viewsourcecode.org/code/dog/DOG.txt).
Dog has instructions that look similar to commands you would give to a dog.
Every command can be preceded by a number or a container variable. It is designed to offer a fun social context
to programming while retaining the basic features of any language.
